OpenMW Enhanced is a Wabbajack version of the [Total Overhaul](https://modding-openmw.com/lists/total-overhaul/) modlist (and credits to Johnnyhostile for that!) and is as close as a 1:1 to that modlist. With some small additions and removals from myself.

OpenMW Enhanced overhauls everything, graphics have been revamped and replaced along with tons of extra content, ranging from Tamriel Rebuilt and Skyrim: Home of the Nords.
## Installation

Before downloading the modlist, make sure you have a folder dedicated for the modlist.
Once you've finished downloading, there are a few things you will want to do before running it for the first time.

- Delete OpenMW in your MyGames folder if it's there, this only applies if you have used OpenMW before.
- Run openmw-wizard.exe
- Linked the morrowind.esm which is found in the Stock Game folder.
- Run mo2
- Go into the plugins and press "export to openmw".
- Go to your MyGames folder, locate and open openmw.cfg
- Using this [file](https://github.com/LeArby/OpenMW-Enhanced/blob/main/openmw.cfg), copy and paste ALL entries into your cfg, starting with and replacing "content=".
- Run openmw-launcher.exe through mo2, if asked press skip installation.
- Adjust and add options to however you like, you may need to reduce graphical settings depending on how good your device is.
- Double check and tick all the archive files under data files, archive files. You can now close the launcher.
- Run OpenMW through mo2.

Enjoy!
This is the only time you need to do this, if you ever add anything, make sure you add it in the content in openmw.cfg. I will get a better way to do this eventually.
