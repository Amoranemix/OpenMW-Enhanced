OpenMW Enhanced is a Wabbajack version of the [Total Overhaul](https://modding-openmw.com/lists/total-overhaul/) modlist (and credits to Johnnyhostile for that!) and is as close as a 1:1 to that modlist. With some small additions and removals from myself.

OpenMW Enhanced overhauls everything, graphics have been revamped and replaced along with tons of extra content, ranging from Tamriel Rebuilt and Skyrim: Home of the Nords.
## Installation
- If you have used 1.0 you may have to do a fresh install if it doesn't work. I'm looking into this.

Before downloading the modlist, make sure you have a folder dedicated for the modlist.
Once you've finished downloading, there are a few things you will want to do before running it for the first time.

- Run openmw-wizard.exe
- Link the morrowind.esm which is found in the Stock Game folder.
- Run mo2
- Run OpenMW Launcher, press skip installation.
- In the launcher you can tinker around to your desired settings. Some to note are the resolution, shadows, draw distance and so forth.
- Now, add this to your settings.cfg - this is  in your MyGames/OpenMW folder.

[Groundcover]

enabled = true 

density = 1.0

stomp mode = 2

stomp intensity = 2

- Run OpenMW through mo2.

Enjoy!
This is the only time you need to do this. I will get a better way to do this eventually.
